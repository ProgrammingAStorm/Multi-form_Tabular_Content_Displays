# Tabular Displays Mockup
A basic, vanilla Javascript implementation of content displays. These content displays are designed to support multiple configurations of size and shape, allowing for rich expression of content and related meta-data in a form that is very natural to the end-user. The goal of this project was to formulate a pattern of design that allows for easy facilitation of responsive, horizontally-scrolling, tabular displays that are highly configurable. The problem was that flex-based layouts tend to lead to lots of wrappers, wheresas, I wanted a design that allows for only using semantic elements as much as possible.

Currently, the state of the website is "you-get-what-you-see," as there is a lack of content-rich displays. That is because this is only inteded to be mock-up/proof-of-concept. While the potential is obvious, this is not a proper implementation. In the future I will completely re-do it with React, Tailwind, and SASS maybe.
